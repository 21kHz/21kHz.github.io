                    We explore the properties of non-piecewise syndetic sets with positive (upper) density, which we call <i>discordant</i>, as they arise in combinatorics, number theory, ergodic theory, and topological and symbolic dynamics.

                    The chromatic <i>B</i>-symmetric function is a generalization of Stanley's chromatic symmetric function to signed graphs.
                    We study this function as it relates to acyclic orientations of signed graphs and obtain a joint generalization of theorems of Stanley and Zaslavsky.

                    Stanley's <i>tree conjecture</i> asks whether the chromatic symmetric function distinguishes non-isomorphic trees.
                    A partial positive result is obtained, showing that a special class of trees (generalizing the notion of a <i>spider</i>) is distinguished.
